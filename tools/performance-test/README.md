# Apigee API performance testing resources collection 

## Description


In order to perform performance and latency testing and validation of the Apigee 
API gateway and of the corresponding backends, tools are needed. 

There is no preference as long as one is able to generate the desired load to reproduce
the test conditions and be able to mesure and observe all the characteristics of the 
systems being benchmarked. 

This section provides the list of most commonly used (but also some less known) tools to
accomplish the mission.
