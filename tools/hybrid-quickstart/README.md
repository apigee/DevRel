# Apigee hybrid Quickstart Script

The aim of this project is to facilitate a fully automated quickstart setup of Apigee hybrid on GKE. The configuration options are limited and simplified on purpose. The resulting Apigee hybrid environment is intended to serve as an initial end to end setup without production grade hardening and reliability.

For tooling related to production setup and operation of Apigee hybrid, please visit the [AHR project on Github](https://github.com/yuriylesyuk/ahr).
